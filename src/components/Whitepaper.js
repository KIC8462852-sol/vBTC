		<Text>
		When a new monetary asset is created the key problem is a matter of distribution - how to fairly distribute it
		to a wide number of participants such that anyone can acquire it and all units are distributed at-cost.
		Bitcoin has a unique monetary policy in that the number of units in the economy are fixed and cannot be increased, 
		all units must be purchased “at-cost”, and that anyone can participate. This makes it superior to gold, which exhibits 
		similar attributes and has been known for millennia, (Szabo, 2020). However, Ethereum (a permissionless blockchain)
		and the tokens running on it’s peer-to-peer network have not undergone the same process. Virtual Bitcoin was created to
		mimic Bitcoin's properties and to mimic Proof-of-Work (PoW), it will use a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Burn (PoB), this is to 
		simulate energy used from the creation of blocks. The purpose of PoB is to deter malicious activity on the network by destroying capital on-chain.
		This will ensure integrity of the network.

		<Text bold={'TRUE'}>Acquiring Virtual Bitcoin</Text><br />
		<Text>
		Virtual Bitcoin can only be acquired by destroying an asset with existing value, such as Ether.
		All assets are destroyed by sending them to an unspendable Ethereum address. 
		</Text><br /><br />

		<Text bold={'TRUE'}>Emission Period</Text><br />
		<Text>
		Virtual Bitcoin will operate on the basis of halving the rewards every 210,000 blocks, this is referred to as an Era (4 years), see Appendx A for emission table. This is a 
		fixed-supply capped at 21 million that is emitted over a predefined schedule the same as Bitcoin.  
		</Text><br /><br />

		<Text bold={'TRUE'}>Network Fee</Text><br />
		<Text>
		Each transaction of Virtual Bitcoin incurs a small fee of 0.1%, which is returned to the contract.
		</Text><br /><br />

		<Text bold={'TRUE'}>Stock-To-Flow</Text><br />
		<Text>
		Virtual Bitcoin begins with a stock-to-flow of 1 that doubles each Era.

		<Text bold={'TRUE'}>Conclusion</Text><br />
		<Text>
		vBTC is an Ethereum-based asset that mimics Bitcoin’s properties of; scarcity, a self-managing asset that cannot be attacked, unforgeable costliness and permissionless distribution. 
		vBTC has implemented Proof-of-Burn (PoB), a substitute for Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) a consensus mechanism used to protect the overall integrity of the network.
